Assigment Q1 for INF1008

Task:/n
Write a singly linked list ADT implementation that achieves O(1) time for insertion and
removals at any location of the linked list. Your implementation should also provide for a
O(1) time get(i) method where i is the position of the item in the list.
The source data must be stored as a singly linked list, but you can make use of any additional data structure to facilitate the operations.

Explain and justify why your implementation has achieved the stated time complexity requirements.
